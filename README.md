# Vehicle Contact
An API and maybe one day website for contacting the owner of a vehicle.

# Issues
x Login gives you API key and refresh token
x Use API key until expired
- Check expiry date when using API key (not just before verification)
- Use refresh token to get a new API key without login
- Replace current refresh token with new one (use once)
- Refresh tokens should expire after 10 days if not used for refreshing
