# Vehicle Contact
An API and maybe one day website for contacting the owner of a vehicle.

# Issues
x Login gives you API key and refresh token
x Use API key until expired
x Check expiry date when using API key (not just before verification)
x Use refresh token to get a new API key without login
x Replace current refresh token with new one (use once)
x Refresh tokens should expire after 10 days if not used for refreshing
x Delete all old tokens when creating new
